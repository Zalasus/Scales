2 - Foreword
============

    This is the specification of the Scales scripting language.

    Scales is the official scripting language for the NRPG3 game engine. It is
    also designed to be easily integrated into other applications.



3 - Design paradigms
====================

    Scales was designed to do basic tasks on script-layer as also to be able to
    delegate them to the underlaying implementation.

    As performance is one of the most important features of the Scales language,
    it is designed to be compiled during runtime rather than to be interpreted.



4 - Programming paradigms
=========================

    -Imperative
    -Structured
    -Object-oriented



5 - Type system
===============

    -Weak
    -Static
    -Explicit


6 - Data types
==========================

    Scales knows the following data types:

        int     -   32 bit signed integer
        long    -   64 bit signed integer
        float   -   32 bit IEEE 754 float representation with unified NaN
        double  -   64 bit IEEE 754 float representation with unified NaN
        string  -   byte array with a max. length of 2^32 - 1
        object  -   container for primitives and objects
